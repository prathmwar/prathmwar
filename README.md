**#Maximum Average Subarray**
This Java code provides a solution to the problem of finding a contiguous subarray of length k within an integer array nums that has the maximum average value. The code calculates the maximum average value and returns it. 

Problem Description:
Given an integer array nums consisting of n elements and an integer k, the goal is to find a contiguous subarray of length k with the maximum average value.

Example:
int[] nums = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3];
int k = 4;
Output
Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
**Code Explanation**
The code is implemented in the Solution class, which contains the method findMaxAverage. 
The method calculates the maximum average subarray by iterating through the input array nums and applying a sliding window approach.

1.Initialize a variable s to keep track of the sum of the first k elements in the array.
2.Iterate through the first k elements in the array and add them to s.
3.Initialize a variable ans with the value of s.
4.Iterate from index k to the end of the array.
5.Update s by subtracting the element at index i - k and adding the element at index i.
6.Update ans by taking the maximum of its current value and s.
7.Finally, return ans / k as the maximum average value.

**Note**
The code assumes that the input array nums has at least k elements.
The code utilizes the Math.max function to keep track of the maximum average value during the sliding window process.

**Conclusion**
This Java code offers an efficient solution to the problem of finding a contiguous subarray of length k with the maximum average value within an integer array. The sliding window technique helps optimize the process, and the code ensures that the solution meets the required calculation error threshold.
